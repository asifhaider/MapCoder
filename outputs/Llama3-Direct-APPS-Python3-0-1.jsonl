{"name": "3554", "description": "Zonk is addictive dice game. In each round player rolls 6 dice. Then (s)he composes combinations from them. Each combination gives certain points. \n\nThen player can take one or more dice combinations to his hand and re-roll remaining dice or save his score. Dice in player's hand won't be taken into account in subsequent rolls.\n\nIf no combinations can be composed - situation is called \"zonk\". Player thrown zonk loses all points in this round and next player moves. So it's player decision when to reroll and when to stop and save his score.\n\nYour task is simple - just evaluate current roll and return maximum number of points can be scored from it. If no combinations can be made - function must return string ``\"Zonk\"`` (without quotes).\n\nThere are different variations of Zonk. In this kata, we will use most common table of combinations:\n\nCombinationExample rollPoints\nStraight (1,2,3,4,5 and 6)6 3 1 2 5 41000 points\nThree pairs of any dice2 2 4 4 1 1750 points\nThree of 11 4 1 11000 points\nThree of 22 3 4 2 2200 points\nThree of 33 4 3 6 3 2300 points\nThree of 44 4 4400 points\nThree of 52 5 5 5 4500 points\nThree of 66 6 2 6600 points\nFour of a kind1 1 1 1 4 62 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 2000 pts)\nFive of a kind5 5 5 4 5 53 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1500 pts)\nSix of a kind4 4 4 4 4 44 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1600 pts)\nEvery 14 3 1 2 2100 points\nEvery 55 2 650 points\n\n\nEach die cannot be used in multiple combinations the same time, so three pairs of 2, 3 and 5 will worth you only ``750`` points (for three pairs), not 850 (for three pairs and two fives). But you can select multiple combinations, ``2 2 2 1 6`` will worth you ``300`` points (200 for three-of-kind '2' plus 100 for single '1' die)\n\nExamples:\n```python\n  get_score([1,2,3]) # returns 100 = points from one 1\n  get_score([3,4,1,1,5]) # returns 250 = points from two 1 and one 5\n  get_score([2,3,2,3,3,2]) # returns 500 = three of 2 + three of 3\n  get_score([1,1,1,1,1,5]) # returns 3050 = five 1 + one 5\n  get_score([2,3,4,3,6,6]) # returns \"Zonk\" = no combinations here\n  get_score([2,2,6,6,2,2]) # returns 400 = four 2, this cannot be scored as three pairs\n  get_score([1,3,4,3,4,1]) # returns 750 = three pairs\n  get_score([3,3,3,3]) # returns 600 = four of 3\n  get_score([1,2,3,4,5]) # returns 150 = it's not straight\n```\nOf course, in real Zonk game it's sometimes not worth to collect all combination from roll. Taking less dice and rerolling more remaining may be better, but task is just to calculate maximum possible score from current single roll.\n\nP.S.

{"name": "3478", "description": "Magic The Gathering is a collectible card game that features wizards battling against each other with spells and creature summons. The game itself can be quite complicated to learn. In this series of katas, we'll be solving some of the situations that arise during gameplay. You won't need any prior knowledge of the game to solve these contrived problems, as I will provide you with enough information.\n\n## Creatures\n\nEach creature has a power and toughness. We will represent this in an array. [2, 3] means this creature has a power of 2 and a toughness of 3.\n\nWhen two creatures square off, they each deal damage equal to their power to each other at the same time. If a creature takes on damage greater than or equal to their toughness, they die.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Creature 1 - [2, 3]\n- Creature 2 - [3, 3]\n- Creature 3 - [1, 4]\n- Creature 4 - [4, 1]\n\nIf creature 1 battles creature 2, creature 1 dies, while 2 survives. If creature 3 battles creature 4, they both die, as 3 deals 1 damage to 4, but creature 4 only has a toughness of 1.\n\nWrite a function `battle(player1, player2)` that takes in 2 arrays of creatures. Each players' creatures battle each other in order (player1[0] battles the creature in player2[0]) and so on. If one list of creatures is longer than the other, those creatures are considered unblocked, and do not battle.\n\nYour function should return an object (a hash in Ruby) with the keys player1 and player2 that contain the power and toughness of the surviving creatures.\n\nExample:\n```\nGood luck with your battles!\n\n\nCheck out my other Magic The Gathering katas:\n\n\nMagic The Gathering #1: Creatures\nMagic The Gathering #2: Mana", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 3478, "sample_io": [], "test_list": [{"input": "[[2, 3], [1, 4]]\n[[3, 3], [4, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[3, 3]]}]}, {"input": "[]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 1]]\n[[1, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[2, 1]]\n[[2, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 2]]\n[[1, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 2]], "player2": [[1, 2]]}]}, {"input": "[[2, 3]]\n[[3, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[2, 7]]\n[[3, 5]]", "output": [{"player1": [[2, 7]], "player2": [[3, 5]]}]}, {"input": "[[2, 5]]\n[[6, 6]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[6, 6]]}]}, {"input": "[[6, 6]]\n[[2, 5]]", "output": [{"player1": [[6, 6]], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[]\n[[1, 1], [2, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[1, 1], [2, 2]]}]}, {"input": "[[1, 1], [2, 2]]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 1], [2, 2]], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 3], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5, 2]]\n[[2, 4], [6, 1], [4, 4], [3, 7], [3, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 3], [4, 6]], "player2": [[2, 4], [3, 7], [3, 1]]}]}], "starter_code": "\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n    results = {'player1': [], 'player2': []}\n    \n    for i in range(min(len(player1), len(player2))):\n        creature1_power, creature1_toughness = player1[i]\n        creature2_power, creature2_toughness = player2[i]\n        \n        damage_dealt_to_creature1 = max(0, creature2_power - creature1_toughness)\n        damage_dealt_to_creature2 = max(0, creature1_power - creature2_toughness)\n        \n        if damage_dealt_to_creature1 > 0 and damage_dealt_to_creature2 > 0:\n            player1[i] = [creature1_power, creature1_toughness - damage_dealt_to_creature1]\n            player2[i] = [creature2_power, creature2_toughness - damage_dealt_to_creature2]\n        elif damage_dealt_to_creature1 > 0:\n            player1[i] = [creature1_power, creature1_toughness - damage_dealt_to_creature1]\n        else:\n            player2[i] = [creature2_power, creature2_toughness - damage_dealt_to_creature2]\n    \n    results['player1'] = player1\n    results['player2'] = player2\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\nplayer1 = [[2, 3], [5, 4]]\nplayer2 = [[3, 3], [4, 1]]\n\noutput = battle(player1, player2)\nprint(output)\n\n\n"], "responses": ["Here is the Python code to solve this problem:\n```python\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n    results = {'player1': [], 'player2': []}\n    \n    for i in range(min(len(player1), len(player2))):\n        creature1_power, creature1_toughness = player1[i]\n        creature2_power, creature2_toughness = player2[i]\n        \n        damage_dealt_to_creature1 = max(0, creature2_power - creature1_toughness)\n        damage_dealt_to_creature2 = max(0, creature1_power - creature2_toughness)\n        \n        if damage_dealt_to_creature1 > 0 and damage_dealt_to_creature2 > 0:\n            player1[i] = [creature1_power, creature1_toughness - damage_dealt_to_creature1]\n            player2[i] = [creature2_power, creature2_toughness - damage_dealt_to_creature2]\n        elif damage_dealt_to_creature1 > 0:\n            player1[i] = [creature1_power, creature1_toughness - damage_dealt_to_creature1]\n        else:\n            player2[i] = [creature2_power, creature2_toughness - damage_dealt_to_creature2]\n    \n    results['player1'] = player1\n    results['player2'] = player2\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\nplayer1 = [[2, 3], [5, 4]]\nplayer2 = [[3, 3], [4, 1]]\n\noutput = battle(player1, player2)\nprint(output)\n```\nThis code iterates over the creatures in both players' lists and simulates a battle between each pair of creatures.

{"name": "4391", "description": "## The Story\nGreen Lantern's long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site. Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere's nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern's ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he's experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn't actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here's the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You're not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don't think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don't know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"lemonchiffon\"    \"PaleGreen\"\n\"GOLD\"            \"ForestGreen\"\n\"pAlEgOlDeNrOd\"   \"LightGreen\"\n\"BlueViolet\"      \"BlueViolet\"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don't know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color's red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as \"yellow\" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these \"yellow\" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"#000000\"   \"#000000\"\n\"#b8860b\"   \"#0bb886\"\n\"#8FBC8F\"   \"#8FBC8F\"\n\"#C71585\"   \"#C71585\"\n```", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 4391, "sample_io": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef yellow_be_gone(s):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef color_fixer(color):\n    if color[0].isalpha():\n        color = color.lower()\n        color_mapping = {\n            'gold': 'forestgreen',\n            'khaki': 'limegreen',\n            'lemonchiffon': 'palegreen',\n            'lightgoldenrodyellow': 'springgreen',\n            'lightyellow': 'mintcream',\n            'palegoldenrod': 'lightgreen',\n            'yellow': 'lime'\n        }\n        return color_mapping.get(color, color)\n\n    else:\n        # convert hex to RGB\n        r, g, b = int(color[1:3], 16), int(color[3:5], 16), int(color[5:], 16)\n        \n        if (r > g) and (g > b):\n            return f\"#{b:02x}{g:02x}{r:02x}\"\n        \n        else:\n            return color\n\n# Test the function\nprint(color_fixer('lemonchiffon'))    # Should print \"PaleGreen\"\nprint(color_fixer('GOLD'))            # Should print \"ForestGreen\"\nprint(color_fixer('pAlEgOlDeNrOd'))   # Should print \"LightGreen\"\nprint(color_fixer('BlueViolet'))      # Should print \"BlueViolet\"\n\nprint(color_fixer('#000000'))         # Should print \"#000000\"\nprint(color_fixer('#b8860b'))          # Should print \"#b8860b\"\nprint(color_fixer('#8FBC8F'))          # Should print \"#8FBC8F\"\nprint(color_fixer('#C71585'))          # Should print \"#C71585\"\n\nhex_code = input()\ncolor_fixer(hex_code)\n\n\n"], "responses": ["Here's your solution in python:\n\n```python\ndef color_fixer(color):\n    if color[0].isalpha():\n        color = color.lower()\n        color_mapping = {\n            'gold': 'forestgreen',\n            'khaki': 'limegreen',\n            'lemonchiffon': 'palegreen',\n            'lightgoldenrodyellow': 'springgreen',\n            'lightyellow': 'mintcream',\n            'palegoldenrod': 'lightgreen',\n            'yellow': 'lime'\n        }\n        return color_mapping.get(color, color)\n\n    else:\n        # convert hex to RGB\n        r, g, b = int(color[1:3], 16), int(color[3:5], 16), int(color[5:], 16)\n        \n        if (r > g) and (g > b):\n            return f\"#{b:02x}{g:02x}{r:02x}\"\n        \n        else:\n            return color\n\n# Test the function\nprint(color_fixer('lemonchiffon'))    # Should print \"PaleGreen\"\nprint(color_fixer('GOLD'))            # Should print \"ForestGreen\"\nprint(color_fixer('pAlEgOlDeNrOd'))   # Should print \"LightGreen\"\nprint(color_fixer('BlueViolet'))      # Should print \"BlueViolet\"\n\nprint(color_fixer('#000000'))         # Should print \"#000000\"\nprint(color_fixer('#b8860b'))          # Should print \"#b8860b\"\nprint(color_fixer('#8FBC8F'))          # Should print \"#8FBC8F\"\nprint(color_fixer('#C71585'))          # Should print \"#C71585\"\n\nhex_code = input()\ncolor_fixer(hex_code)\n```\nNow you can use the function color\\_fixer with any hex code as an argument."], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 4391}

The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "1232\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "123220\n6", "output": [true]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef is_polydivisible(n, b):\n    n = int(n)\n    for i in range(1, len(str(n))+1):\n        if n % eval(''.join(map(str, range(i)))) != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n\ndef get_polydivisible(n, b):\n    chars = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n    max_base = 62\n\n    def convert(num, base):\n        result = ''\n        while num > 0:\n            num, remainder = divmod(num, base)\n            result = chars[remainder] + result\n        return result\n\n    i = n -

The first function checks whether a given number `n` is polydivisible in base `b`, while the second function generates the `n`th polydivisible number in base `b`.

{"name": "1663", "description": "In this Kata we focus on finding a sum S(n) which is the total number of divisors taken for all natural numbers less or equal to n. More formally, we investigate the sum of n components denoted by d(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) in which for any i starting from 1 up to n the value of d(i) tells us how many distinct numbers divide i without a remainder. \n\nYour solution should work for possibly large values of n without a timeout.\nAssume n to be greater than zero and not greater than 999 999 999 999 999.\nBrute force approaches will not be feasible options in such cases. It is fairly simple to conclude that for every n>1 there holds a recurrence S(n) = S(n-1) + d(n) with initial case S(1) = 1.\n\nFor example:\nS(1) = 1\nS(2) = 3\nS(3) = 5\nS(4) = 8\nS(5) = 10\n\nBut is the fact useful anyway? If you find it is rather not, maybe this will help: \n\nTry to convince yourself that for any natural k, the number S(k) is the same as the number of pairs (m,n) that solve the inequality mn <= k in natural numbers.\nOnce it becomes clear, we can think of a partition of all the solutions into classes just by saying that a pair (m,n) belongs to the class indexed by n.\nThe question now arises if it is possible to count solutions of n-th class. If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\n\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one.

He's figured out most of the digits as well as a few operators, but he needs your help to figure out the rest.\n\nThe professor will give you a simple math expression, of the form\n\n```\n[number][op][number]=[number]\n```\n\nHe has converted all of the runes he knows into digits. The only operators he knows are addition (`+`),subtraction(`-`), and multiplication (`*`), so those are the only ones that will appear. Each number will be in the range from -1000000 to 1000000, and will consist of only the digits 0-9, possibly a leading -, and maybe a few ?s. If there are ?s in an expression, they represent a digit rune that the professor doesn't know (never an operator, and never a leading -). All of the ?s in an expression will represent the same digit (0-9), and it won't be one of the other given digits in the expression. No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is  0, therefore 00 would not be a valid number. \n\nGiven an expression, figure out the value of the rune represented by the question mark. If more than one digit works, give the lowest one. If no digit works, well, that's bad news for the professor - it means that he's got some of his runes wrong. output -1 in that case.\n\nComplete the method to solve the expression to find the value of the unknown rune. The method takes a string as a paramater repressenting the expression and will return an int value representing the unknown rune or -1 if no such rune exists.\n\n~~~if:php\n**Most of the time, the professor will be able to figure out most of the runes himself, but sometimes, there may be exactly 1 rune present in the expression that the professor cannot figure out (resulting in all question marks where the digits are in the expression) so be careful ;)**\n~~~", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1654, "sample_io": [], "test_list": [{"input": "123?45*?=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?*123?45=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "??605*-63=-73???5", "output": [1]}, {"input": "123?45+?=123?45", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?8?170-1?6256=7?2?14", "output": [9]}, {"input": "?38???+595???=833444", "output": [2]}, {"input": "123?45-?=123?45", "output": [0]}, {"input": "-7715?5--484?00=-28?9?5", "output": [6]}, {"input": "50685?--1?5630=652?8?", "output": [4]}, {"input": "??+??=??", "output": [-1]}, {"input": "-?56373--9216=-?47157", "output": [8]}], "starter_code": "\ndef solve_runes(runes):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\nfrom itertools import permutations\nimport sys\n\ndef find_x(expression):\n    # Split the expression into three parts: left number, operator and right number\n    left_num = expression.split('=')[0]\n    op = expression.split('=')[1][0]\n    right_num = expression.split('=')[1].split(op)[1]\n\n    # Generate all possible combinations of numbers for each part\n    all_left_nums = [''.join(p) for p in permutations(''.join(left_num.replace('?', '123456789')), len(left_num))]\n    all_right_nums = [''.join(p) for p in permutations(right_num, len(right_num))]\n\n    # Check which combination satisfies the equation\n    valid_combinations = set()\n    for left_num in all_left_nums:\n        for right_num in all_right_nums:\n            if (eval(left_num + op + right_num.replace('?', ''))) == eval(expression.split('=')[1].split(op)[0]):\n                valid_combinations.add((left_num, right_num))\n\n    # If no combination satisfies the equation, return -1\n    if len(valid_combinations) == 0:\n        return -1\n\n    # Check which number can only be used in one combination\n    x = ''\n    count_dict = {}\n    for left_num, right_num in valid_combinations:\n        for digit in ''.join(left_num + right_num):\n            if digit not in count_dict:\n                count_dict[digit] = 0\n            count_dict[digit] += 1\n\n    # Find the number with a unique combination\n    for num, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count == len(valid_combinations) - 1:\n            x = num\n            break\n\n    return int(x)\n\n# Input expression from standard input\nexpression = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n# Print result to standard output\nprint(find_x(expression))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["Here is the python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nimport sys\n\ndef find_x(expression):\n    # Split the expression into three parts: left number, operator and right number\n    left_num = expression.split('=')[0]\n    op = expression.split('=')[1][0]\n    right_num = expression.split('=')[1].split(op)[1]\n\n    # Generate all possible combinations of numbers for each part\n    all_left_nums = [''.join(p) for p in permutations(''.join(left_num.replace('?', '123456789')), len(left_num))]\n    all_right_nums = [''.join(p) for p in permutations(right_num, len(right_num))]\n\n    # Check which combination satisfies the equation\n    valid_combinations = set()\n    for left_num in all_left_nums:\n        for right_num in all_right_nums:\n            if (eval(left_num + op + right_num.replace('?', ''))) == eval(expression.split('=')[1].split(op)[0]):\n                valid_combinations.add((left_num, right_num))\n\n    # If no combination satisfies the equation, return -1\n    if len(valid_combinations) == 0:\n        return -1\n\n    # Check which number can only be used in one combination\n    x = ''\n    count_dict = {}\n    for left_num, right_num in valid_combinations:\n        for digit in ''.join(left_num + right_num):\n            if digit not in count_dict:\n                count_dict[digit] = 0\n            count_dict[digit] += 1\n\n    # Find the number with a unique combination\n    for num, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count == len(valid_combinations) - 1:\n            x = num\n            break\n\n    return int(x)\n\n# Input expression from standard input\nexpression = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n# Print result to standard output\nprint(find_x(expression))\n```\n\nThis code first splits the input expression into three parts: left number, operator and right number. Then it generates all possible combinations of numbers for each part using permutations. It checks which combination satisfies the equation by evaluating the expression with different combinations of numbers. If no combination satisfies the equation, it returns -1. Otherwise, it finds the number that can only be used in one combination and returns it."], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1654}

Same goes for all the numbers up to 109, while 110 is again a decreasing number.\n\nNow your task is rather easy to declare (a bit less to perform): you have to build a function to return the total occurrences of all the increasing or decreasing numbers *below* 10 raised to the xth power (x will always be >= 0).\n\nTo give you a starting point, there are a grand total of increasing and decreasing numbers as shown in the table:\n\n|Total  | Below\n|---------------\n|1      | 1\n|10     | 10\n|100    | 100\n|475    | 1000\n|1675   | 10000\n|4954   | 100000\n|12952  | 1000000\n\nThis means that your function will have to behave like this:\n```python\ntotal_inc_dec(0)==1\ntotal_inc_dec(1)==10\ntotal_inc_dec(2)==100\ntotal_inc_dec(3)==475\ntotal_inc_dec(4)==1675\ntotal_inc_dec(5)==4954\ntotal_inc_dec(6)==12952\n```\n\n**Tips:** efficiency and trying to figure out how it works are essential: with a brute force approach, some tests with larger numbers may take more than the total computing power currently on Earth to be finished in the short allotted time.\n\nTo make it even clearer, the increasing or decreasing numbers between in the range 101-200 are: [110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 166, 167, 168, 169, 177, 178, 179, 188, 189, 199, 200], that is 47 of them.

{"name": "1627", "description": "### Background\n\nI was reading a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Things-Make-Do-Fourth-Dimension/dp/1846147646/) recently, \"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension\" by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker, and in the first chapter of the book Matt talks about problems he likes to solve in his head to take his mind off the fact that he is in his dentist's chair, we've all been there!\n\nThe problem he talks about relates to polydivisible numbers, and I thought a kata should be written on the subject as it's quite interesting. (Well it's interesting to me, so there!)\n\n### Polydivisib... huh what?\n\nSo what are they?\n\nA polydivisible number is divisible in an unusual way. The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "1232\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "123220\n6", "output": [true]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef is_polydivisible(n, b):\n    base = 62\n    chrs = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n    \n    # Convert n from base b to base 10\n    n_base10 = 0\n    for i in range(len(n)):\n        d = int(chrs[ord(n[i]) -

Now count the number of ways in which you can choose letters in this way to make the full phrase.\n\nMore precisely, given a text string, you are to determine how many times the search string appears as a sub-sequence of that string.\n\nWrite a function called `countSubsequences` that takes two arguments: `needle`, the string to be search for and `haystack`, the string to search in. In our example, `\"happy birthday\"` is the needle and the birthday message is the haystack. The function should return the number of times `needle` occurs as a sub-sequence of `haystack`.

{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation see Wikipedia: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}], "test_list": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "00 5/ 4/ 53 33 22 4/ 5/ 45 XXX", "output": [115]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 8/8", "output": [150]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 7/2", "output": [143]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}, {"input": "6/ 5/ 6/ 2/ 3/ 0/ 1/ 8/ 3/ 6/5", "output": [139]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0/X", "output": [20]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 X 0/X", "output": [40]}], "starter_code": "\ndef bowling_score(frames):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    total_score = 0\n    \n    # Loop through each frame in the string\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(frames):\n        if frames[i] == 'X':\n            # Strike\n            total_score += 10 + get_next_two_frames(frames, i)\n            i += 1  # Move to next frame\n        elif frames[i] == '/':\n            # Spare\n            spare_value = int(frames[i-1]) + int(frames[i+1])\n            total_score += 10 + int(frames[i+1])\n            i += 2  # Move to the last frame of this spare and then to the next frame\n        else:\n            # Regular frame\n            total_score += int(frames[i:i+3])\n            i += 3  # Move to the next three characters\n    \n    return total_score\n\n\ndef get_next_two_frames(frames, current_index):\n    index = frames.find(' ', current_index) + 1\n    first_frame_value = ''\n    \n    while True:\n        try:\n            value = int(frames[index])\n            first_frame_value += str(value)\n            if '/' in frames[index+2:index+4]:\n                break\n            else:\n                index = frames.find(' ', index + 1) + 1\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Error parsing input.

For each frame it checks if it's a strike, spare or regular frame. If it's a strike or spare then it calculates the score for that roll and adds on the next two rolls. It does this until all frames have been processed.\n\nThe `get_next_two_frames` function is used to get the value of the next two frames after a strike/spare. This involves parsing through the string to find the first frame value, then finding the value of the second frame (which will either be another roll or the third roll in a spare).\n\nPlease note that you should input the string from standard input and print the output to standard output as per the problem requirements."], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1622}

{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation see Wikipedia: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}], "test_list": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "00 5/ 4/ 53 33 22 4/ 5/ 45 XXX", "output": [115]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 8/8", "output": [150]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 7/2", "output": [143]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}, {"input": "6/ 5/ 6/ 2/ 3/ 0/ 1/ 8/ 3/ 6/5", "output": [139]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0/X", "output": [20]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 X 0/X", "output": [40]}], "starter_code": "\ndef bowling_score(frames):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    scores = []\n    for i in range(len(frames)):\n        if frames[i] == 'X':\n            # Strike, add 10 + next two rolls\n            if i < len(frames) - 1 and frames[i+1].isdigit():\n                score = int(frames[i+1]) + int(frames[i+2])\n                scores.append(score)\n                i += 2\n            else:\n                scores.append(10)\n\n        elif frames[i] == '/':\n            # Spare, add 10 + next roll\n            if i < len(frames) - 1 and frames[i+1].isdigit():\n                score = int(frames[i+1]) + int(frames[i+2])\n                scores.append(score)\n                i += 2\n\n        else:\n            # Normal frame, add two rolls\n            scores.append(int(frames[i]))\n\n    return sum(scores)\n\n# Read input from standard input\nframes = input()\n\n# Calculate and print score\nscore = bowlingScore(frames.replace('X', '10').replace('/', '10+'))\nprint(score)\n\n\n"], "responses": ["Here is the Python3 code that solves the Ten-Pin Bowling problem:\n```python\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    scores = []\n    for i in range(len(frames)):\n        if frames[i] == 'X':\n            # Strike, add 10 + next two rolls\n            if i < len(frames) - 1 and frames[i+1].isdigit():\n                score = int(frames[i+1]) + int(frames[i+2])\n                scores.append(score)\n                i += 2\n            else:\n                scores.append(10)\n\n        elif frames[i] == '/':\n            # Spare, add 10 + next roll\n            if i < len(frames) - 1 and frames[i+1].isdigit():\n                score = int(frames[i+1]) + int(frames[i+2])\n                scores.append(score)\n                i += 2\n\n        else:\n            # Normal frame, add two rolls\n            scores.append(int(frames[i]))\n\n    return sum(scores)\n\n# Read input from standard input\nframes = input()\n\n# Calculate and print score\nscore = bowlingScore(frames.replace('X', '10').replace('/', '10+'))\nprint(score)\n```\nNote that this code uses the `input()` function to read a string of frames from standard input, and then calls the `bowlingScore()` function with this input.

NEKO's task is to lead a Nekomimi girl from cell $(1, 1)$ to the gate at $(2, n)$ and escape the maze. The girl can only move between cells sharing a common side.\n\nHowever, at some moments during the game, some cells may change their state: either from normal ground to lava (which forbids movement into that cell), or vice versa (which makes that cell passable again). Initially all cells are of the ground type.\n\nAfter hours of streaming, NEKO finally figured out there are only $q$ such moments: the $i$-th moment toggles the state of cell $(r_i, c_i)$ (either from ground to lava or vice versa).\n\nKnowing this, NEKO wonders, after each of the $q$ moments, whether it is still possible to move from cell $(1, 1)$ to cell $(2, n)$ without going through any lava cells.\n\nAlthough NEKO is a great streamer and gamer, she still can't get through quizzes and problems requiring large amount of Brain Power.

One of the shortest path ways should be: $(1,1) \\to (1,2) \\to (1,3) \\to (1,4) \\to (1,5) \\to (2,5)$.  After the second query, it's impossible to move to the goal, since the farthest cell she could reach is $(1, 3)$.  After the fourth query, the $(2, 3)$ is not blocked, but now all the $4$-th column is blocked, so she still can't reach the goal.  After the fifth query, the column barrier has been lifted, thus she can go to the final goal again.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2064, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4\n2 3\n1 4\n",

We are allowed coefficients in set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.\nFirstly let's note that the number of monomials is k+1, and we have a constant term 1.\nNow, if m_i < fac[8], there will be only one polynomial (x^m).\nIf m_i >= fac[8] , then we need to distribute m_i -fac[7] to the eight coefficients. We must make sure that at least seven are zero or less.\nThis is similar to distributing some objects into nine boxes, subject to certain conditions.\nThe first condition says that there are 7 empty boxes (coefficients being either 0,1,2,3,4,5,6).\nUsing Stars and Bars we can count all ways of distributing m_i -fac[7] to the eight coefficients."], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2233}

For each $i$ from $1$ to $|s|$, the $i$-th character of $s$ is denoted by $s_i$. \n\nThere is one cursor. The cursor's location $\\ell$ is denoted by an integer in $\\{0, \\ldots, |s|\\}$, with the following meaning:   If $\\ell = 0$, then the cursor is located before the first character of $s$.  If $\\ell = |s|$, then the cursor is located right after the last character of $s$.  If $0 < \\ell < |s|$, then the cursor is located between $s_\\ell$ and $s_{\\ell+1}$. \n\nWe denote by $s_\\text{left}$ the string to the left of the cursor and $s_\\text{right}$ the string to the right of the cursor. \n\nWe also have a string $c$, which we call our clipboard, which starts out as empty. There are three types of actions:  The Move action. Move the cursor one step to the right. This increments $\\ell$ once.  The Cut action. Set $c \\leftarrow s_\\text{right}$, then set $s \\leftarrow s_\\text{left}$.  The Paste action. Append the value of $c$ to the end of the string $s$. Note that this doesn't modify $c$. \n\nThe cursor initially starts at $\\ell = 0$. Then, we perform the following procedure:  Perform the Move action once.  Perform the Cut action once.  Perform the Paste action $s_\\ell$ times.  If $\\ell = x$, stop. Otherwise, return to step 1. \n\nYou're given the initial string $s$ and the integer $x$. What is the length of $s$ when the procedure stops?

Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 2 times: we get $s = $ 23131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 1 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 2$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23 and $c = $ 131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 2 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 3$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 231 and $c = $ 31131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 time: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 3 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 4$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2313 and $c = $ 1131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 4 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 5$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23131 and $c = $ 13113111311311131131.

{"name": "2095", "description": "A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.\n\nLet's consider a rooted undirected tree with n vertices, numbered 1 through n. There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, where p_{i} denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent). [Image] For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2]. \n\nGiven a sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, one is able to restore a tree:  There must be exactly one index r that p_{r} = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree.  For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex p_{i}. \n\nA sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.\n\nYou are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.\n\nIn the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}) in the minimum number of changes.

The $i$-th box contains $n_i$ integer numbers. The integers can be negative. All of the integers are distinct. \n\nUjan is lazy, so he will do the following reordering of the numbers exactly once. He will pick a single integer from each of the boxes, $k$ integers in total. Then he will insert the chosen numbers\u00a0\u2014 one integer in each of the boxes, so that the number of integers in each box is the same as in the beginning.

{"name": "2047", "description": "Allen dreams of one day owning a enormous fleet of electric cars, the car of the future! He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\n [Image] Illustration to the first example. \n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 2n$), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\n\nThe next four lines will contain $n$ integers each between $0$ and $k$ inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n\nOutput\n6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2047, "sample_io": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2

The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.\n\nA player spends d\u00b7dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|.\n\nInitially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).\n\nNow Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n and d (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 10^3 \u2264 d \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of stations and the constant from the statement.\n\nThe second line contains n - 2 integers: a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} - 1 (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^3). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers x_{i}, y_{i} (-100 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 100).\n\nIt is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print an integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1000\n1000\n0 0\n0 1\n0 3\n\nOutput\n2000\n\nInput\n3 1000\n1000\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n\nOutput\n1000", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2026, "sample_io": [{"input": "3 1000\n1000\n0 0\n0 1\n0 3\n", "output": ["2000\n"]}, {"input": "3 1000\n1000\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n", "output": ["1000\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "3 1000\n1000\n0 0\n0 1\n0 3\n", "output": ["2000\n"]}, {"input": "3 1000\n1000\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n", "output": ["1000\n"]}, {"input": "5 1421\n896 448 727\n-19 -40\n-87 40\n69 51\n-55 61\n-7 67\n", "output": ["169099\n"]}, {"input": "6 1000\n142 712 254 869\n7 0\n95 38\n96 -20\n-7 93\n75 -45\n-80 -20\n", "output": ["107000\n"]}, {"input": "7 1288\n943 265 649 447 806\n-4 -51\n-26 32\n47 -28\n31 32\n61 65\n-45 -37\n82 42\n", "output": ["229903\n"]}, {"input": "8 1931\n440 627 324 538 539 119\n-85 -41\n-91 61\n-84 11\n92 -19\n8 -5\n16 -25\n97 -98\n91 78\n", "output": ["569018\n"]}, {"input": "9 1829\n98 513 987 291 162 637 356\n38 -3\n-89 93\n-86 45\n-43 -84\n-3 -87\n53 -59\n18 -19\n81 -74\n-85 32\n", "output": ["288982\n"]}, {"input": "10 1000\n759 222 589 423 947 507 31 414\n-4 -71\n-31 -53\n24 28\n-13 -65\n-59 -49\n-42 -79\n85 -71\n-60 -17\n28 66\n74 2\n", "output": ["151000\n"]}, {"input": "11 1199\n282 735 54 1000 419 939 901 789 128\n10 -81\n26 72\n19 -91\n-61 85\n0 -33\n-62 79\n-59 65\n-2 -77\n-63 100\n-15 53\n94 54\n", "output": ["262581\n"]}, {"input": "12 1609\n196 486 94 344 524 588 315 504 449 201\n86 -22\n-2 25\n-95 -8\n-5 -30\n-78 71\n5 -54\n-69 -92\n-41 0\n10 19\n61 17\n75 -39\n-46 22\n", "output": ["282231\n"]}, {"input": "3 97325\n40\n43 43\n45 -95\n-93 63\n", "output": ["15182700\n"]}, {"input": "11 1615\n137 681 199 33 388 585 241 518 7\n-60 89\n24 6\n-100 -55\n-26 -90\n-40 -33\n-100 28\n12 34\n-60 -13\n38 -89\n62 81\n-35 54\n", "output": ["96900\n"]}, {"input": "4 62071\n706 480\n6 96\n51 -12\n99 66\n-69 -61\n", "output": ["14400472\n"]}, {"input": "12 1542\n389 356 290 648 182 94 585 988 762 494\n-46 96\n1 88\n0 95\n-91 -100\n-42 -29\n45 -27\n-52 -34\n-62 27\n-19 46\n-100 95\n5 -55\n-36 -65\n", "output": ["263034\n"]}, {"input": "3 100000\n1\n-100 -100\n-100 -99\n100 100\n", "output": ["39999999\n"]}, {"input": "12 1211\n1 5 7 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000\n1 1\n5 5\n3 4\n4 3\n0 1\n0 2\n0 5\n0 7\n1 0\n3 0\n8 0\n10 10\n", "output": ["20220\n"]}, {"input": "6 1000\n1000 1000 1000 1000\n0 0\n0 -1\n1 -1\n2 -1\n2 0\n2 1\n", "output": ["1000\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\n\nn, d = map(int, input().split())\na = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))\nx, y = [0]*101, [0]*101\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    x[i], y[i] = map(int, input().split())\n\ndis = [[sys.maxsize]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\ndist = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        dis[i+1][j+1] = min(dis[i+1][j], dis[j+1][i]) + abs(x[i+1]-x[j+1]) + abs(y[i+1]-y[j+1])\nfor i in range(2, n-1):\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        dist[i+1][j] = min(dist[i+1][j], dis[i][i] - a[i])\n\ndp = [[sys.maxsize]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\nfor i in range(1, n-1):\n    dp[i][i] = 0\nfor i in range(2, n-1):\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        if dist[i+1][j] >= 0:\n            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], (a[j] + dist[i+1][j])*d)\n            for k in range(j+1, n):\n                dp[i][k] = min(dp[i][k], dp[i][j]+(dis[j][k]-a[k])*d)\n\nprint(a[n-1]*d+max([dp[1][i]//d for i in range(n)]))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["Here is a python solution for the given problem.

The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. \n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).\n\nPolycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible.

Then we read the time and interest value for each task.\n- We sort all the tasks by their interest value in descending order. The most interesting task will be at position 0 and so on.\n- Now we can start calculating dp values. `dp[i][j]` is the maximum total interest of tasks that can be included in a quest that takes exactly `j` minutes to complete, where only the first `i` tasks are considered.\n- If a task can't fit into the remaining time, then we either include it or not and see which case gives us higher total interest. But if the task fits into the remaining time then we must include it in order to get higher total interest.\n- Finally, we just print out `dp[n][T]` as this contains the maximum possible total interest of tasks that can be included in a quest that takes exactly T minutes to complete.\n\nNote: We are using dynamic programming here. The idea is to solve subproblems and store them somewhere so they don't have to be recalculated every time you need their solution. This helps us avoid repeating calculations over and over again, which would make our program much slower. \n\nAlso note that we are considering only `i-1` tasks while calculating the maximum total interest for `dp[i][j]`. This is because we can always include at most one task in each \"level\" of the quest tree. If a task takes 2 minutes to complete, it will be on the same level as any task that also takes 2 minutes to complete and there's only one task per level."], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2159}

This mistake have been fixed and the current given problem statement and model solution corresponds to what jury wanted it to be during the contest.\n\nVova and Lesha are friends. They often meet at Vova's place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat, so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possible.\n\nThere are n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position.\n\nVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha.

of nodes and edges as well as two time values a and b. Then it builds an adjacency list representation of the graph where each edge is weighted with either a or b seconds.\n\nAfter that, it calculates the minimum spanning tree for each possible subset of roads that can be removed (denoted by either 0 or 1 in all positions).\n\nIn calculating this minimum spanning tree, it uses Kruskal's algorithm to add the smallest possible roads first. For each such road, if its weight is greater than b, we know that removing all roads with weight a would leave us unable to reach some node from any other node; hence, for those nodes, we can simply remove their connection to the rest of the graph by setting its minimum time requirement to be 0.\n\nThe script also keeps track of the total weight of the remaining edges in each possible MST. This total weight is then stored as a value in `min_times[i][j]`, representing the minimum time required to travel from node i to node j after some roads are abandoned.\n\nFinally, for each node j, it selects the smaller of the times when all roads with weight a and b have been removed respectively and output this as part of a list. This is because removing either all roads with weight a or all roads with weight b will result in a spanning tree where we can still reach node i but not necessarily node j.\n\nThus, this script produces an array where each value represents the minimum possible time required to travel from the king's residence (node 1) to the parliament house (node p), for all nodes p."], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2000}
{"name": "2065", "description": "Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-famous detective. He is now investigating the case of vandalism at the exhibition of contemporary art.\n\nThe main exhibit is a construction of n matryoshka dolls that can be nested one into another. The matryoshka dolls are numbered from 1 to n. A matryoshka with a smaller number can be nested in a matryoshka with a higher number, two matryoshkas can not be directly nested in the same doll, but there may be chain nestings, for example, 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 5. \n\nIn one second, you can perform one of the two following operations:  Having a matryoshka a that isn't nested in any other matryoshka and a matryoshka b, such that b doesn't contain any other matryoshka and is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may put a in b;  Having a matryoshka a directly contained in matryoshka b, such that b is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may get a out of b. \n\nAccording to the modern aesthetic norms the matryoshka dolls on display were assembled in a specific configuration, i.e. as several separate chains of nested matryoshkas, but the criminal, following the mysterious plan, took out all the dolls and assembled them into a single large chain (1 \u2192 2 \u2192 ... \u2192 n). In order to continue the investigation Andrewid needs to know in what minimum time it is possible to perform this action.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of matryoshkas and matryoshka chains in the initial configuration.\n\nThe next k lines contain the descriptions of the chains: the i-th line first contains number m_{i} (1 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 n), and then m_{i} numbers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im}_{i} \u2014 the numbers of matryoshkas in the chain (matryoshka a_{i}1 is nested into matryoshka a_{i}2, that is nested into matryoshka a_{i}3, and so on till the matryoshka a_{im}_{i} that isn't nested into any other matryoshka).\n\nIt is guaranteed that m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_{k} = n, the numbers of matryoshkas in all the chains are distinct, in each chain the numbers of matryoshkas follow in the ascending order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the single line print the minimum number of seconds needed to assemble one large chain from the initial configuration.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test there are two chains: 1 \u2192 2 and 3. In one second you can nest the first chain into the second one and get 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3.\n\nIn the second sample test you need to disassemble all the three chains into individual matryoshkas in 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 seconds and then assemble one big chain in 6 seconds.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2065, "sample_io": [{"input": "3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n", "output": ["10\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n", "output": ["10\n"]}, {"input": "1 1\n1 1\n", "output": ["0\n"]}, {"input": "3 2\n1 2\n2 1 3\n", "output": ["3\n"]}, {"input": "5 3\n1 4\n3 1 2 3\n1 5\n", "output": ["2\n"]}, {"input": "8 5\n2 1 2\n2 3 4\n1 5\n2 6 7\n1 8\n", "output": ["8\n"]}, {"input": "10 10\n1 5\n1 4\n1 10\n1 3\n1 7\n1 1\n1 8\n1 6\n1 9\n1 2\n", "output": ["9\n"]}, {"input": "20 6\n3 8 9 13\n3 4 14 20\n2 15 17\n3 2 5 11\n5 7 10 12 18 19\n4 1 3 6 16\n", "output": ["33\n"]}, {"input": "50 10\n6 17 21 31 42 45 49\n6 11 12 15 22 26 38\n3 9 29 36\n3 10 23 43\n5 14 19 28 46 48\n2 30 39\n6 13 20 24 33 37 47\n8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n7 16 18 25 27 34 40 44\n4 32 35 41 50\n", "output": ["75\n"]}, {"input": "13 8\n1 5\n2 8 10\n1 13\n4 1 2 3 11\n1 7\n2 6 12\n1 4\n1 9\n", "output": ["13\n"]}, {"input": "21 13\n1 18\n2 8 13\n1 21\n1 17\n2 7 9\n1 20\n1 19\n1 4\n1 16\n2 5 6\n3 12 14 15\n3 1 2 3\n2 10 11\n", "output": ["24\n"]}, {"input": "50 50\n1 2\n1 5\n1 28\n1 46\n1 42\n1 24\n1 3\n1 37\n1 33\n1 50\n1 23\n1 40\n1 43\n1 26\n1 49\n1 34\n1 8\n1 45\n1 15\n1 1\n1 22\n1 18\n1 27\n1 25\n1 13\n1 39\n1 38\n1 10\n1 44\n1 6\n1 17\n1 47\n1 7\n1 35\n1 20\n1 36\n1 31\n1 21\n1 32\n1 29\n1 4\n1 12\n1 19\n1 16\n1 11\n1 41\n1 9\n1 14\n1 30\n1 48\n", "output": ["49\n"]}, {"input": "100 3\n45 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 19 21 24 27 28 30 34 35 37 39 40 41 42 43 46 47 48 51 52 55 58 59 61 63 64 66 69 71 76 80 85 86 88 89 94 99\n26 10 11 15 18 23 29 31 33 36 38 44 49 54 56 60 62 65 75 78 82 83 84 95 96 97 98\n29 12 13 14 16 17 20 22 25 26 32 45 50 53 57 67 68 70 72 73 74 77 79 81 87 90 91 92 93 100\n", "output": ["180\n"]}, {"input": "100 19\n6 62 72 83 91 94 97\n3 61 84 99\n1 63\n5 46 53 56 69 78\n5 41 43 49 74 89\n5 55 57 79 85 87\n3 47 59 98\n3 64 76 82\n3 48 66 75\n2 60 88\n2 67 77\n4 40 51 73 95\n41 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 44 71 81\n4 58 65 90 93\n1 100\n5 39 45 52 80 86\n2 50 68\n1 92\n4 42 54 70 96\n", "output": ["106\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["\ndef count_operations(n, k):\n    chains = []\n    for _ in range(k):\n        m = int(input().split()[0])\n        chain = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        chains.append(chain)\n    \n    total_moves = 0\n    \n    # Count the moves required to disassemble each chain into individual matryoshkas\n    for i in range(len(chains)):\n        total_moves += len(chains[i]) - 1\n        \n    # Count the moves required to reassemble all matryoshkas into a single large chain\n    if n > 1:\n        total_moves += (n - 2)\n    \n    print(total_moves)\n\n# Input\ninput()\ncount_operations(*list(map(int, input().split())))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["Here's a python solution for this problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_operations(n, k):\n    chains = []\n    for _ in range(k):\n        m = int(input().split()[0])\n        chain = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        chains.append(chain)\n    \n    total_moves = 0\n    \n    # Count the moves required to disassemble each chain into individual matryoshkas\n    for i in range(len(chains)):\n        total_moves += len(chains[i]) - 1\n        \n    # Count the moves required to reassemble all matryoshkas into a single large chain\n    if n > 1:\n        total_moves += (n - 2)\n    \n    print(total_moves)\n\n# Input\ninput()\ncount_operations(*list(map(int, input().split())))\n```\n\nThis code will first read the number of matryoshkas and chains.

{"name": "2198", "description": "There are some ambiguities when one writes Berland names with the letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nFor example, the Berland sound u can be written in the Latin alphabet as \"u\", and can be written as \"oo\". For this reason, two words \"ulyana\" and \"oolyana\" denote the same name.\n\nThe second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both \"h\" and \"kh\" to write it. For example, the words \"mihail\" and \"mikhail\" denote the same name.\n\nThere are n users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?\n\nFormally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements \"u\"\u00a0[Image]\u00a0\"oo\" and \"h\"\u00a0[Image]\u00a0\"kh\", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.\n\nFor example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:  \"koouper\" and \"kuooper\". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: \"koouper\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kuuper\" and \"kuooper\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kuuper\".  \"khun\" and \"kkkhoon\". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: \"khun\" $\\rightarrow$ \"khoon\" and \"kkkhoon\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kkhoon\" $\\rightarrow$ \"khoon\". \n\nFor a given list of words, find the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer number n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 400) \u2014 number of the words in the list.\n\nThe following n lines contain words, one word per line.

The robot has two different arms \u2014 the left one and the right one. The robot can consecutively perform the following actions:   Take the leftmost item with the left hand and spend w_{i} \u00b7 l energy units (w_{i} is a weight of the leftmost item, l is some parameter).

If the previous action was the same (right-hand), then the robot spends extra Q_{r} energy units; \n\nNaturally, Vasya wants to program the robot in a way that the robot spends as little energy as possible.

In order for the processing to be truly of high quality, the application must receive at least k photos with contrasts which differ as little as possible.\n\nEvlampiy already knows the contrast v_{i} for each of his n photos. Now he wants to split the photos into groups, so that each group contains at least k photos. As a result, each photo must belong to exactly one group.\n\nHe considers a processing time of the j-th group to be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of v_{i} in the group. Because of multithreading the processing time of a division into groups is the maximum processing time among all groups.\n\nSplit n photos into groups in a such way that the processing time of the division is the minimum possible, i.e. that the the maximum processing time over all groups as least as possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 number of photos and minimum size of a group.\n\nThe second line contains n integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_{n} (1 \u2264 v_{i} \u2264 10^9), where v_{i} is the contrast of the i-th photo.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimal processing time of the division into groups.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n50 110 130 40 120\n\nOutput\n20\n\nInput\n4 1\n2 3 4 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the photos should be split into 2 groups: [40, 50] and [110, 120, 130].
