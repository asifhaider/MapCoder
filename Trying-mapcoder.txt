# Problem:
Zonk is addictive dice game. In each round player rolls 6 dice. Then (s)he composes combinations from them. Each combination gives certain points. 

Then player can take one or more dice combinations to his hand and re-roll remaining dice or save his score. Dice in player's hand won't be taken into account in subsequent rolls.

If no combinations can be composed - situation is called "zonk". Player thrown zonk loses all points in this round and next player moves. So it's player decision when to reroll and when to stop and save his score.

Your task is simple - just evaluate current roll and return maximum number of points can be scored from it. If no combinations can be made - function must return string ``"Zonk"`` (without quotes).

There are different variations of Zonk. In this kata, we will use most common table of combinations:

CombinationExample rollPoints
Straight (1,2,3,4,5 and 6)6 3 1 2 5 41000 points
Three pairs of any dice2 2 4 4 1 1750 points
Three of 11 4 1 11000 points
Three of 22 3 4 2 2200 points
Three of 33 4 3 6 3 2300 points
Three of 44 4 4400 points
Three of 52 5 5 5 4500 points
Three of 66 6 2 6600 points
Four of a kind1 1 1 1 4 62 × Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 2000 pts)
Five of a kind5 5 5 4 5 53 × Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1500 pts)
Six of a kind4 4 4 4 4 44 × Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1600 pts)
Every 14 3 1 2 2100 points
Every 55 2 650 points


Each die cannot be used in multiple combinations the same time, so three pairs of 2, 3 and 5 will worth you only ``750`` points (for three pairs), not 850 (for three pairs and two fives). But you can select multiple combinations, ``2 2 2 1 6`` will worth you ``300`` points (200 for three-of-kind '2' plus 100 for single '1' die)

Examples:
```python
  get_score([1,2,3]) # returns 100 = points from one 1
  get_score([3,4,1,1,5]) # returns 250 = points from two 1 and one 5
  get_score([2,3,2,3,3,2]) # returns 500 = three of 2 + three of 3
  get_score([1,1,1,1,1,5]) # returns 3050 = five 1 + one 5
  get_score([2,3,4,3,6,6]) # returns "Zonk" = no combinations here
  get_score([2,2,6,6,2,2]) # returns 400 = four 2, this cannot be scored as three pairs
  get_score([1,3,4,3,4,1]) # returns 750 = three pairs
  get_score([3,3,3,3]) # returns 600 = four of 3
  get_score([1,2,3,4,5]) # returns 150 = it's not straight
```
Of course, in real Zonk game it's sometimes not worth to collect all combination from roll. Taking less dice and rerolling more remaining may be better, but task is just to calculate maximum possible score from current single roll.

====================== Output ======================

===================== Attempt 1 =====================
Here are three relevant problems with step-by-step solutions and planning:

**Problem 1:**

<description>
Find the first duplicate in an array of integers.
</description>

<code>
# Define a function to find the first duplicate
def find_first_duplicate(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return num
        seen.add(num)
    return None

# Test the function
arr1 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(find_first_duplicate(arr1))  # Output: None

arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]
print(find_first_duplicate(arr2))  # Output: 2
</code>

<planning>
1. Define an empty set `seen` to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far.
2. Iterate through the input array `arr`.
3. For each number `num`, check if it's already in the `seen` set. If it is, return the number as the first duplicate.
4. If not, add the number to the `seen` set and continue iterating.
5. If we reach the end of the array without finding a duplicate, return `None`.
</planning>

**Problem 2:**

<description>
Given an integer `n`, find all prime numbers up to `n`.
</description>

<code>
# Define a function to generate all primes up to n
def get_primes(n):
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, int(i ** 0.5) + 1):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(i)
    return primes

# Test the function
n = 20
print(get_primes(n))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
</code>

<planning>
1. Initialize an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.
2. Iterate through the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive).
3. For each number `i`, assume it's prime and initialize a flag `is_prime` to `True`.
4. Check if `i` is divisible by any number `j` from 2 to the square root of `i`. If it is, set `is_prime` to `False` and break the loop.
5. If `i` is still considered prime (i.e., `is_prime` is `True`), add it to the `primes` list.
6. Return the list of primes.
</planning>

**Problem 3:**

<description>
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character.
</description>

<code>
# Define a function to find the first non-repeating char
def first_non_repeating_char(s):
    char_count = {}
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1

    for char in s:
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return char
    return None

# Test the function
s1 = "abcde"
print(first_non_repeating_char(s1))  # Output: 'd'

s2 = "abba"
print(first_non_repeating_char(s2))  # Output: None
</code>

<planning>
1. Initialize an empty dictionary `char_count` to keep track of the character counts.
2. Iterate through the input string `s`.
3. For each character, increment its count in the `char_count` dict if it already exists; otherwise, set its count to 1.
4. Reiterate through the input string.
5. For each character, check if its count is 1. If so, return the character as the first non-repeating char.
6. If we reach the end of the string without finding a non-repeating char, return `None`.
</planning>

**Algorithm:**

<description>
The original problem can be solved using the **Brute-force** algorithm.

A brute-force solution involves trying all possible solutions until one is found that satisfies the conditions. This approach can be time-consuming and inefficient for large inputs but works well for small cases or when an exact solution is required.

In this case, we used a brute-force approach to find the first duplicate in an array of integers, generate prime numbers up to a given integer, and identify the first non-repeating character in a string.
</description>

<planning>
**What is Brute Force Algorithm?**

The brute force algorithm involves trying all possible solutions until one that satisfies the conditions is found.

**How does it work?**

1. Define all possible solutions
2. Check each solution against the given condition
3. Return the first solution that meets the condition

**Example:**

* Finding the first duplicate in an array of integers:
	+ Try each integer to see if it's already present in the array.
	+ Return the first integer that's found twice.
* Generating prime numbers up to a given integer:
	+ Check each number from 2 to the given integer (inclusive) to see if it's divisible by any other number.
	+ Return the first number that passes this test.

**Advantages and Disadvantages:**

Advantages:

* Easy to implement
* Works well for small inputs

Disadvantages:

* Inefficient for large inputs
* May take a long time to execute

<algorithm>
The algorithm used to solve these problems is Brute Force, which involves trying all possible solutions and checking each one to see if it satisfies the problem's constraints.

Tutorial:

Brute force algorithms are often used when the problem size is small or when the solution is easy to verify. However, they can be inefficient for large problem sizes because they involve trying all possible solutions, which can take a lot of time and resources.

Here are some general tips for using brute force algorithms:

*   Make sure that the problem size is relatively small.
*   Try to find ways to reduce the number of possibilities by applying constraints or using heuristics.
*   Use techniques such as memoization or dynamic programming to avoid redundant computations.
*   Be prepared for long execution times, especially if the problem size is large.

Some common use cases for brute force algorithms include:

*   Finding a solution to a small-scale optimization problem.
*   Verifying that a certain condition holds true for all possible inputs.
*   Enumerating all possible solutions to a problem, even if it's inefficient.

When using brute force algorithms, keep in mind that they may not always provide the optimal or most efficient solution. However, they can be useful when other approaches are too complex or difficult to implement.

Here is an example of how you might apply the Brute Force algorithm to find the longest common substring between two strings:

1.  Start by considering all possible substrings in the first string.
2.  For each substring, check if it's present in the second string.
3.  If a match is found, update the longest common substring accordingly.

The time complexity of this approach would be O(n^2), where n is the length of the strings.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you might implement a brute force algorithm to solve these problems:

```python
def find_solution():
    # Brute Force algorithm for finding the longest common substring
    s1 = "ABCABCD"
    s2 = "BCADBCD"

    max_len = 0
    max_str = ""

    for i in range(len(s1)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s1) + 1):
            substr_val = s1[i:j]

            if substr_val in s2 and len(substr_val) > max_len:
                max_len = len(substr_val)
                max_str = substr_val

    return max_str


def check_close_elements():
    # Brute Force algorithm for checking close elements
    numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]
    threshold = 0.3

    dist = float("inf")

    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                dist = min(dist, abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]))

    return dist <= threshold


def find_longest_common_substring():
    # Brute Force algorithm for finding the longest common substring
    s1 = "ABCABCD"
    s2 = "BCADBCD"

    max_len = 0
    max_str = ""

    for i in range(len(s1)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s1) + 1):
            substr_val = s1[i:j]

            if substr_val in s2 and len(substr_val) > max_len:
                max_len = len(substr_val)
                max_str = substr_val

    return max_str


def main():
    print(find_solution())
    print(check_close_elements())
    print(find_longest_common_substring())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The code above demonstrates how to use the Brute Force algorithm to solve these problems. The solution involves using nested loops to consider all possible substrings and checking if they're present in the second string.

Keep in mind that brute force algorithms can be inefficient for large problem sizes. Therefore, it's essential to apply constraints or use heuristics to reduce the number of possibilities before applying the algorithm.

1. Define a function `count_islands` that takes the grid as input.
2. If the grid is empty, return 0.
3. Initialize the count to 0 and get the number of rows and columns in the grid.
4. Iterate through each cell in the grid.
5. If the cell represents land (`'L'`), perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from that cell and increment the count.
6. After iterating through all cells, return the final count.

<algorithm>
**Algorithm:**

The original problem involves checking if any two numbers in a list are within a certain threshold of each other. This can be solved using a simple Brute-force algorithm.

**Brute-force Algorithm Tutorial:**

A brute-force algorithm is one that checks all possible solutions to a problem, often resulting in inefficient performance for large inputs. However, for smaller inputs or specific problem domains, it can be effective.

Here's how you might approach solving this type of problem using brute force:

1.  **Define the Problem Space:** Clearly understand what constitutes a valid solution within your given constraints.
2.  **Generate All Possibilities:** Create all possible combinations or iterations that fit your criteria, whether it's numbers in an array, paths on a grid, or any other scenario where brute force applies.
3.  **Evaluate Each Solution:** Check each generated possibility to see if it meets the problem's requirements.
4.  **Return the Result:** Once you find a solution (or all solutions), return them as your final answer.

While this approach can be straightforward, keep in mind its limitations—especially for complex problems where brute force is impractical due to time or resource constraints.

For more complex problems where brute-force isn't feasible or efficient, consider other algorithms like dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, backtracking, recursion, binary search, or even more advanced techniques depending on the problem domain. Each algorithm has its strengths and use cases, so choose the one that best fits your specific challenge.

**When to Use Brute Force:**

1.  **Small Input Sizes:** When dealing with small inputs where processing time is not a significant concern.
2.  **Simplistic Problems:** For straightforward problems where no shortcuts or optimizations are required.
3.  **Educational Purposes:** As an introduction to algorithmic thinking and problem-solving in computing.

**Remember:**

-   Brute force works best for simple, well-defined problems with small input sizes.
-   It's essential to identify the most appropriate algorithm based on the problem's nature and constraints.
-   Practice and experience will help you develop a keen sense of which algorithms are most suitable for different types of problems.

Here are three relevant problems with their solutions:

<problem>
<description>
**Problem 1: Find Maximum Sum Subarray**
Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum subarray within that array.
</description>
<code>
```python
def max_sum_subarray(arr):
    # Initialize maximum sum and current sum to first element
    max_sum = curr_sum = arr[0]
    
    # Iterate through the array starting from second element
    for num in arr[1:]:
        # Update current sum by choosing maximum between current number and sum of current number and previous current sum
        curr_sum = max(num, curr_sum + num)
        
        # Update maximum sum if current sum is greater than it
        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage:
arr = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]
print(max_sum_subarray(arr))  # Output: 7
```
</code>
<planning>
Planning to solve this problem involves initializing variables for maximum sum and current sum to the first element of the array. Then iterate through the rest of the array, updating current sum by choosing maximum between current number and sum of current number and previous current sum. Update maximum sum if current sum is greater than it.
</planning>

<description>
**Problem 2: Check If Array Contains Duplicate**
Given an array of integers, check if there are any duplicate elements in the array.
</description>
<code>
```python
def has_duplicates(arr):
    # Initialize set to store unique elements
    unique_elements = set()
    
    # Iterate through the array
    for num in arr:
        # If current number is already in set, return True (array contains duplicates)
        if num in unique_elements:
            return True
        
        # Add current number to set
        unique_elements.add(num)
    
    # If we have iterated through entire array and haven't found duplicates, return False
    return False

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(has_duplicates(arr))  # Output: False

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
print(has_duplicates(arr))  # Output: True
```
</code>
<planning>
Planning to solve this problem involves initializing an empty set to store unique elements. Then iterate through the array, checking if each current number is already in the set. If it is, return True (array contains duplicates). Otherwise, add the current number to the set.
</planning>
</problem>

<description>
**Problem 3: Find First Duplicate Element**
Given an array of integers, find the first duplicate element in the array.
</description>

    # Iterate through dictionary to find first duplicate element
    for num, count in num_counts.items():
        # If count is greater than 1, return current number as first duplicate element
        if count > 1:
            return num
    
    # If we have iterated through entire array and haven't found duplicates, return None
    return None

print(find_first_duplicate(arr))  # Output: None

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
print(find_first_duplicate(arr))  # Output: 4
```

# **Algorithm: Dynamic Programming**

Dynamic programming is an algorithmic technique used for solving problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. It involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computation.

## Tutorial

1.  **Identify the Problem**: Determine whether the given problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
2.  **Break Down the Problem**: Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that have the same structure as the original problem.
3.  **Create a Table**: Create a table to store solutions of subproblems, called a dynamic programming table.
4.  **Fill Up the Table**: Fill up the table by solving each subproblem only once and storing its solution in the table.
5.  **Read from the Table**: Read the solution to the original problem from the table.

Dynamic programming is particularly useful when:

*   The problem has overlapping subproblems (the same subproblems are solved multiple times).
*   The problem has optimal substructure (the global optimum can be constructed from local optima).

Some examples of dynamic programming include:

*   **Fibonacci Series**: The Fibonacci series is a classic example of dynamic programming, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
*   **Shortest Path Problem**: Finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph involves solving subproblems (shortest paths to neighboring nodes) and storing their solutions.
*   **Knapsack Problem**: The knapsack problem is an example of dynamic programming where we need to find the optimal subset of items to include in a knapsack given its capacity.

By following these steps, you can apply dynamic programming to solve various problems efficiently.

===================== Attempt 1 =====================
Here are three relevant problems with descriptions, Python3 code, and planning:

<problem>

<description>
Find all unique triplets in a given list of integers that add up to zero.
</description>

<code>
# Step 1: Define the function
def find_triplets(nums):
    # Step 2: Sort the list
    nums.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Iterate over the list with three pointers
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue
        
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            
            # Step 4: Check the condition
            if total < 0:
                left += 1
            elif total > 0:
                right -= 1
            else:
                return [nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]
    
    return []

# Example usage
print(find_triplets([-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]))
</code>

<planning>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

*   Sort the list of integers.
*   Iterate over the sorted list with three pointers (i, left, and right).
*   For each triplet, calculate the sum and check if it's equal to zero. If yes, return the triplet.
*   Use a set to keep track of already found triplets to avoid duplicates.

This problem can be solved using a two-pointer technique, which is a common approach for solving problems that require finding pairs or triplets in a sorted list.
</planning>

</problem>

<problem>

<description>
Check if a given string contains any duplicate characters. If yes, return True; otherwise, return False.
</description>

<code>
# Step 1: Define the function
def has_duplicates(s):
    # Step 2: Create a set from the string
    char_set = set()
    
    # Step 3: Iterate over the string and add characters to the set
    for char in s:
        if char in char_set:
            return True
        char_set.add(char)
    
    # Step 4: If no duplicates are found, return False
    return False

# Example usage
print(has_duplicates("hello"))  # Output: False
print(has_duplicates("helli"))   # Output: True
</code>

<planning>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

*   Create a set from the given string.
*   Iterate over the string and add characters to the set. If any character is already present in the set, return True (indicating duplicates).
*   If no duplicates are found after iterating over the entire string, return False.

This problem can be solved using a simple iteration approach with the help of a set data structure.
</planning>

</problem>

<problem>

<description>
Find all permutations of a given list of integers.
</description>

<code>
# Step 1: Define the function
def find_permutations(nums):
    # Step 2: Base case (if the length is 1, return the number itself)
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return [nums]
    
    # Step 3: Initialize an empty list to store permutations
    permutations = []
    
    # Step 4: Iterate over each element in the list
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        current_num = nums[i]
        
        # Step 5: Remove the current number from the list and generate permutations recursively
        remaining_nums = nums[:i] + nums[i+1:]
        for perm in find_permutations(remaining_nums):
            permutations.append([current_num] + perm)
    
    # Step 6: Return all permutations
    return permutations

# Example usage
print(find_permutations([1, 2, 3]))
</code>

<planning>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

*   Define a recursive function that generates all permutations.
*   Base case: If the length of the list is 1, return the number itself (which is the only permutation).
*   Iterate over each element in the list and remove it from the list.
*   Recursively generate permutations for the remaining list and add the removed number to each permutation.
*   Store all generated permutations in a list and return it.

This problem can be solved using a recursive approach with backtracking.
